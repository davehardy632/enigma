the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.
war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.
god created war so that americans would learn geography.
i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought, but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones.
war must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but i do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. i love only that which they defend.
